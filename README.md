# Project Desription
This repository contains the following two projects:
* A C# program that determines the lesser angle between the hour and minute hands of a 12 hour analoge clock ([link](https://github.com/Tinsae-Tadesse/REIZ-Tech/blob/master/Angle%20Calculator/Program.cs)).
* A C# program that **recursively** builds a tree of branchs and calculates the number of sub-branches that exist on the longest branch tree ([link](abcs)).
